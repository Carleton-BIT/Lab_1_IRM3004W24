# Steps to running this application

In your terminal, navigate to the folder where you'd like to save this application.

Then, run:

1. `git clone https://github.com/Carleton-BIT/Lab_1_IRM3004W24.git` (if you get an error like "git is not a valid command" then [install git!](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
2. `cd Workshop_1_IMD2900W24`
3. `pip install django`
4. `python manage.py runserver`

Once that's done, you should be able to access your web application at http://127.0.0.1:8000. You will make changes to this application in this workshop - and you can view the list of things you need to do on the homepage of the website.

When you're done, upload and submit your work on brightspace.
